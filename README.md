Module 1 Assignment

Getting Started With Programming in C
 


Hey! Welcome to your first assignment. Hope you have had a great learning experience so far with us and now are pretty confident and comfortable writing programs in the C language.  

This assignment is meant to test your programming concepts based on what you have learned in this module (Module 1). Don’t worry! You don’t have to build anything fancy, a simple and clean executable program will work and that is all we need you to do at this moment :) 


Problem Statement: 

Your task is to write a C program to generate the report card of a student based on his marks secured in the final examination.
  

Desired Output:

-----------------------------------------------------------

            Jawahar Navodaya Vidyalaya 

                 Annual Report Card 

 

           Name: Sriyank Siddhartha 

           Standard: 10 

           Section: A 

 

           Marks Secured out of 100 

           Mathematics: 93 

           English: 74 

           Hindi: 85 

           Science: 97 

           Social Science: 81 

 

          Total marks secured: 430 

          Grade: B 

------------------------------------------------------------


Approach:  

Using the following approach you need to first write an algorithm and define the required steps to create the app. For writing algorithms, you can use a sheet of paper or any text editing software such as Microsoft Word. 

Write a code for user input (use appropriate data type as applicable) 
           - Student name  

           - Standard (Class)  

           - Section  

           - Marks secured in  

Mathematics 
English 
Hindi 
Science 
Social Science 
While taking user input, take care of clearing the input buffer stream after scanf() statements (as applicable) by using the following statement:  
- while ((getchar()) != '\n');  

Once you get the marks secured for all the subjects, calculate the total marks secured. 
Now based on the total marks secured, you need to assign a grade to the student. 
         - Grade A 

                   - Total marks secured between 450-500 

         - Grade B 

                 - Total marks secured between 400-449 

         - Grade C 

                  - Total marks secured between 350-399 

         - Grade D 

                  - Total marks secured between 300-349 

         - Grade E 

                  - Total marks secured between 200-299 

         - Grade F 

                  - Total marks secured below 200 but greater than equal to 0

     5. Follow good coding practices to make your code clean. 


Additional Tasks: 

- You may print a decorated welcome message.  

- While accepting user input use user-friendly messages to improve user experience. 

- You may use the usleep() function as per the need.  

- If the total marks secured exceed 500 or are found to be below 0, then your program should terminate and the report card should not be generated.  

Note: You can Google how to terminate (exit) the C program. 

 

Hints: 

- To draw a dashed line use symbol hyphen (-) in the print statements.  

- Use escape as ‘\t’, ‘\n’ wherever needed.  


Submission: 

After completing the assignment, upload the zip file containing the algorithm and source code file. If you have written an algorithm on a paper then upload a photo of it or if you have written an algorithm in an editor then upload the digital file itself.
